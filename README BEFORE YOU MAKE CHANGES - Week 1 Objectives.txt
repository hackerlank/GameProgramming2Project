A message from Tommy:
Nothing new is here for me, so I'm going to work on getting techno points. I'll start by implementing normal mapping. If there is something else that you all would rather me work on, let me know.

Sun:
-Make enemies run at you and add a easy access function to place such enemies.  I'll work on coding it to work with the xml once you've done that
-If you finish that, start work on some kind of boss (Need Justin's input here)
